# Data Visualisation Labs and Projects

The visualisations learned and created during the Data Visualisation course.

## The Project

The project topic is *Global Trade Analysis*. Different visualisations were created to help visualize how the global trade trends have changes over the last 2 decades. All the visualisation were done using D3 JS using Observable notebooks.
